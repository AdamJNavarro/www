        Hey there, my name is Adam Navarro. I’m 29 years old and am a software
        programmer, hobbyist musician and gym rat. Some of my favorite things in this
        life are building things (usually with code) and helping others in whatever
        way I am capable of. Below you can find some of my interests to get to know a
        bit more about me. If you want to talk about something, please don’t hesitate
        to reach out!
