This is simply a placeholder paragraph that will eventually be replaced by my thoughts, intentions, motivations and the story behind the project. It's going to take a little time to hammer out those words so in the interim this will have to suffice. Hopefully it is less jarring than a lorem ipsum block to folks who stumble upon it. A project's story will hopefully be an interesting read for those who visit the website so I'd prefer not to rush things and put up a scatter-brained wall of text that will leave readers in a state of discomboulation.
