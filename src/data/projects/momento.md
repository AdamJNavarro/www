Momento is a mobile app that allows you to create unique, long-lasting video memories with the intention that they be shared with loved ones. Collaborate with friends by collecting videos from them and then once you have all the videos you want, you can create a Momento. A Momento is the final video that stitches all the videos you've collected into one seamless video. You can flex your creative muscles by adding background music, transitions between videos and re-arranging the videos into the order you think will be most impactful. Once you've created your ideal Momento video then it's time to share it with that special person.
