Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps that run on Android, iOS, and the web. It includes a universal runtime and libraries that let you build native apps by writing React and JavaScript.

### Origin Story

Expo was co-founded by [Charlie Cheever](http://ccheever.com/) and [James Ide](https://jameside.com/) in 2013 from a shared desire to make it easier to create and use universal mobile apps that run everywhere.

Fun fact: The company was originally named Exponent until being [renamed to Expo](https://blog.expo.io/exponent-expo-b172fb6725a7) in March of 2017.
