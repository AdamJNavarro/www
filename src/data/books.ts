    title: "To The Lighthouse",
    author: "Virginia Woolf",
    takeaway:
      "Stream of consciousness writing, when executed properly, can craft an incredible narrative experience and Woolf does just that. More often that not, you won't realize you've moved into a different characters head as the transitions are remarkbly smooth. The beginning of the novel can be a bit of a whirlwind but I'd encourage you to perserve if any thoughts of abandonment begin to rear their ugly heads. What resonated most for me is how relentless and unforgiving time can truly be. It renders thoughts moot. It fades relationships away with unnerving ease. It exposes the frailty of the human life for all to see yet perhaps not appreciate.",

    title: "Atomic Habits",
    author: "James Clear",
    takeaway:
      "Focus on your environment. The environment you put yourself in will likely have a more profound impact on effectively changing your habits and lifestyle than any of the other aspects in the habit-forming process. More specifically, really leverage the power of visual cues. If your goal is to workout more, put your workout attire for tomorrow somewhere that it will be easily seen to serve as a visual reminder of your intention. Lastly, habit stacking is a very effective tool. Habit Stacking refers to the process of tightly coupling a habit you already have with a new habit you want to create or strengthen by doing the action associated with the desired habit right after the action associated with your pre-existing habit. For example, if you are already an avid reader but you want to write more often then you would aim to journal right after you've finished reading your book.",

    title: "The Gifts of Imperfection",
    author: "Bren√© Brown",
    takeaway:
      "What resonated most with me was Brown's notion that one can not selectively numb their feelings. When we take the edge off, in whatever fashion that may be, it not only dulls the negative feelings but the positive ones just as much.",

    title: "Getting Things Done",
    author: "David Allen",
    takeaway: `Allen's "Two Minute Rule" has been one of the most useful tools I've incorporated in my daily life. The rule states that if the action required to complete a task can be performed in two minutes or less, you do it right away regardless of urgency or priority. The amount of time is arbitrary and you can adjust it to what would work best for you.`,
