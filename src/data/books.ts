    takeaway:
      "Focus on your environment. The environment you put yourself in will likely have a more profound impact on effectively changing your habits and lifestyle than any of the other aspects in the habit-forming process. More specifically, really leverage the power of visual cues. If your goal is to workout more, put your workout attire for tomorrow somewhere that it will be easily seen to serve as a visual reminder of your intention. Lastly, habit stacking is a very effective tool. Habit Stacking refers to the process of tightly coupling a habit you already have with a new habit you want to create or strengthen by doing the action associated with the desired habit right after the action associated with your pre-existing habit. For example, if you are already an avid reader but you want to write more often then you would aim to journal right after you've finished reading your book.",
